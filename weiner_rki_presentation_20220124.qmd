## Three stories

 * Predicting tuberculosis (TB) onset in patients
 * Operating an RNA-Seq pipeline at the CUBI
 * How not to do gene set enrichments

## Core principles

::: {.incremental}
 * Reproducibility: the analysis should be reproducible with minimal effort
   (always a compromise!); also here: good science practices
 * Accountability: we should be able to trace back every result to its
   underlying data (e.g.: gene set enrichment to differential expression of
   individual genes) with minimal effort; also here: user empowerment
 * Interpretability: we should be able to interpret the results in the
   given biological or medical context; also: collaboration or service?

## Implementing the core principles:

::: {.incremental}
 * Introduced blinded predictions for the validation set
 * All data published
 * Results, paper and supplementary materials generated and written completely in R markdown, available from github

## Implementing the core principles:

::: {.incremental}
 * Reproducibility:
   - keeping track of all analyses
   - –,,– software versions
   - software environments preserved with conda
   - data and meta-data stored in SODAR "forever"
 * Accountability ensured by providing custom interactive interfaces
   $\rightarrow$ read only mode! Not for making the analyses
 * Interpretability 
   - frequent updates and discussions
   - incorporating research hypotheses in the pipeline
   - collaborations rather than service
:::

## How not to do gene set enrichments

 * two groups of patients: G1 and G2
 * two conditions: COVID vs controls
 * do the two groups react differently to COVID?

## How not to do gene set enrichments

 * > 25% of papers on transcriptomics with a venn diagram fall for this
   fallacy
 * correct interpretation: interactions, disco score (Domaszewska et al.
   and Weiner, 2017)
 * paper sources as rmarkdown available from github
